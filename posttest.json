        "a": "Incorrect. The ElGamal private key is not used to generate a random number during decryption.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The ElGamal private key is not involved in computing temporary values during decryption.",
        "c": "Correct. The ElGamal private key is used to compute the shared secret during decryption.",

        "a": "Using the private key",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The private key is not used directly to recover the original message in ElGamal decryption.",
        "b": "Correct. The original message is recovered by multiplying the ciphertext by the inverse of the shared secret.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Computing the inverse of the temporary value is not the standard method for recovering the original message.",

      "question": "In ElGamal encryption, why is it essential for the random number 'k' to be relatively prime to (p-1)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To ensure a unique session key",
        "b": "To prevent key leakage",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Having 'k' relatively prime to (p-1) ensures a unique session key, enhancing security.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The relative primality of 'k' to (p-1) is not primarily related to preventing key leakage.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The relative primality of 'k' to (p-1) is not directly related to avoiding weak key generation.",
